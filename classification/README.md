This code was written over one day for a hackathon. To run it, just run main.sh and it will pull labelled data from orcasound.net and train a classifier using it.
To make the classifier segment an audio file, just put the filename in the spot indicated on the bottom of main.sh
If you've already fetched that data you can skip the fetch by calling './main.sh s'
