# orcadata
Development of bioacoustic analytical tools for both humans (citizen/scientists) and machines (algorithms) to process Orcasound data -- either post-processing of archived raw FLAC files or real-time analyis of the lossy stream and/or FLAC files. The long-term goal is to promote a friendly competition between humans and machines that leads to synergistic real-time, cloud-based processing of acoustic data.

Resources to develop:

Archive of signals, noise, and empirical data for machine learning and teaching human listeners

* Data for Good tarball of sound samples
* Example of Orcasound FLAC files (48, 96, 192 kHz)
* Guidane on how to access S3 buckets (CLI and/or Cloud9)

Overview of AWS tools and plan(s) for utilizing them
* EC2
* Cloud9
* Lamba
* Batch
* ECS

Experiments in cloud-based bio/acoustic analysis

* How to get up to speed with Cloud9 IDE and access to Orcasound data in S3 buckets
* Val's initial Python scripts

Other related open-source projects, and tools for testing tools (e.g. algorithms) with Orcasound data

* Demonstrate how to run a Pamguard module on Orcasound data (archived first; then real-time)
* Ishmael?
* Triton?
